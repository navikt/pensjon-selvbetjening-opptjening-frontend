    "faq-question-1": "How is earned pension calculated in connection with caring for young children?",
    "faq-answer-1": [
        "If you are receiving child benefit, you will automatically be credited with pension earnings for care work for years where you",
        "- have cared for children under the age of six years",
        "- are between 17 and 69 years of age",
        "The pension earnings for care work correspond to the pension you would have earned with an income of 4.5 times the National Insurance basic amount (“G”). If you earn more than this, your earned pension will be based on your earned income instead. Only one of the parents receives pension earnings for care work, but it is possible to transfer the pension earnings for care work to the other parent, if this is more profitable.",
        "If you cared for children before 2010, you have received pension earnings for care work up to and including the year in which the child turned six years of age. This corresponds to the pension earnings you would have received from an income of 4 G.",
        "#### Pension earnings for care work before 1992",
        "There are separate rules for earning an old-age pension and contractual early retirement pension (AFP) in the private sector for people who cared for children under the age of seven years in the period 1967 to 1991.",
        "#### Pension earnings for care work for people born between 1948 and 1953",
        "If you were born between 1948 and 1953, pension earnings for care work for years before 1992 can only be used to calculate contractual early retirement pension (AFP) in the private sector. Read more about contractual early retirement pensions (AFP) in the private sector.",
        "#### Pension earnings for care work for people born in or after 1954",
        "If you were born in or after 1954, pension earnings for care work for years before 1992 can be used to calculate both contractual early retirement pension (AFP) in the private sector and old-age pension from the National Insurance Scheme calculated fully or partially according to new rules that apply from 2016. Read more about old-age pension."

    "faq-question-2": "What does pensionable income mean?",
    "faq-answer-2": [
        "In the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme, “pensionable income” is generally the same as personal income pursuant to the Tax Act, with a few exceptions. This means that all gross earned income for employees and calculated personal income from business activities for self-employed persons is included as pensionable income. Any taxable social security benefits you have received, such as sickness benefit and work assessment allowance (AAP), are also counted as part of your pensionable income.",

The condition in this case is that you have earned pension earnings for care work in the past three years."
    ],

    "faq-question-4": "Is this all my pension earnings?",
    "faq-answer-4": "Only pension earnings in the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme that provide the basis for an old-age pension from Nav are shown here. Any public or private occupational pension or contractual early retirement pension (AFP) you are entitled to, or any other individual pension plans you have, will not be included here. In the Pension Calculator, we collect information from public and most private pension companies. The Pension Calculator will thus provide a better overview of your total pension rights."
